# Project 01 - Pantry Meals & Music

## Description:
This project uses HTML, JS, and CSS to build our website Pantry Meals & Music. This website uses two server side APIs to fetch 5 recipes based off of the ingredient that you search, and the other API will pull up a song based on that ingredient as well. We also have a Local Storage feature that allows you to save anything you don't have at home.
